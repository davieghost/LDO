			<h2 class="storyHeadline">The Lindsey Marie Eyles Dance Scholarship celebrates the life of Lindsey Eyles, her passion for life and love of dance.</h2>
			<p class="standardP">Lindsey was truly a special girl who touched the lives of everyone who met her with her captivating personality and sparkling smile. In April of 2009, when Lindsey was just 9 years old, she was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, a very rare cancer of the soft tissue affecting only 300 children per year. She underwent an intense 9-month chemotherapy/radiation treatment plan causing her to lose her beautiful hair and miss many days of school. Throughout Lindsey's illness and lengthy hospital stays, her courage and strength kept a smile on her face while she remained focused on homework, dance and soccer.</p>
			<p class="standardP">Lindsey was treatment-free until March of 2010 when her cancer returned. The new protocol required her to move to Texas just one month prior to her dance recital. Lindsey was so determined to be a part of the ballet show that she rehearsed her steps in Houston via choreography notes and classroom videos. On the day of the recital, she attended her one and only dress rehearsal before flawlessly dancing in three performances â€“ a true testament to her character and dedication to dance.</p>
			<p class="standardP">Sadly, Lindsey's 18-month fight with cancer ended on November 28, 2010. Lindsey is truly missed by so many; however, her joyful spirit, positive attitude and determination continue to be an inspiration to all. Her talent, coupled with her endless energy and passion for dance, made her an exceptional young dancer.</p>
